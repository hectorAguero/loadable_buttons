/// error and stack trace propagate.

/// Each activation captures its handler before calling `onPressed`. Disposal
/// does not cancel either callback. No context is supplied; check your own
/// lifecycle before using captured state or context. Only returned or awaited
/// Futures are tracked. Long-press and presentation callbacks are not covered.
